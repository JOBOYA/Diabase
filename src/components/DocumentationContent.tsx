Setting up a masternode on the Diabase Blockchain can be a rewarding way to contribute to the network's operations while earning rewards. This guide will walk you through the process of setting up your own Diabase Blockchain masternode, from preparing the necessary requirements to configuring and running your node.

Note: This guide assumes you have basic knowledge of Linux and command-line interfaces. If you're new to these concepts, consider seeking assistance or educating yourself further before proceeding.

 

Requirements:

Technical Knowledge: Basic understanding of Linux commands and terminal usage.

Hardware: A dedicated server or Virtual Private Server (VPS) meeting the minimum requirements:

CPU: Multi-core processor (2 cores or more)

RAM: At least 2GB (more recommended)

Storage: 20GB of free disk space (SSD recommended)

Network: Stable and high-speed internet connection

Diabase Blockchain (DIAC) Coins: 1000 of Diabase Blockchain coins DIAC to use as collateral for your masternode.

Static IP Address: Obtain a static IP address for your VPS or server.

This documentation describes the commands as if they were entered in the Diabase GUI by opening the console from Window {">"} Console, but the same result can be achieved on a masternode by entering the same commands and adding the prefix ~/.diabasecore/diabase-cli to each command.
